# Objectives

* Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://markdown-previewer.freecodecamp.rocks/.*

# Tasks:

* **Task #1:** I can see a textarea element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
* **Task #2:** I can see a textarea element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
* **Task #3:** When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
* **Task #4:** When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as **HTML** in the `#preview` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
* **Task #5:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (`H1` size), a sub heading element (`H2` size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
* **Task #6:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as **HTML** in the `#preview` element.
